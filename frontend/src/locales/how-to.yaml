    md-content: |-
      Dear users,

      Resourcebase is imagined as an online educational resource designed to help you reach debate materials for education and support your debate-based youth work.

      You can search through materials by topics, type of activity, the curriculum you would like to use, age, and experience of the young people you are working on.
      These features will guide you to the best possible combination of resources we can recommend for you to use in your debate-based youth work.

      There are several types of resources available, and you can choose which ones you want to be shown by selecting.


      # "Type of material"

      Under this filter, you can choose

      **Lesson plans** - stand-alone instructions on organizing a lesson on different debate topics.

      **Coaching guide** - Manuals for debate-based youth work. The manuals aim to develop skills or knowledge on implementing debate methodology and core principles of non-formal debate education.

      **Program guide** - Manuals for more comprehensive debate program development, not necessarily focusing on skills of the individual but instead creating quality standards, developing volunteering, and describing processes for successful development of a debate club or a debate program in a community.

      **Curriculum** - Base documents on how to implement and organize proposed lesson plans and work in a community-based debate club.

      # The "Duration"

      Filter is available only for lesson plans where you can select lessons based on how much time you have to perform a single activity with young people.

      # "Type of activity"

      Here you can select what type of debate program you are interested in. If you are aiming for a long-term debate club development or a short-term organization of a community debate action? Different lesson plans and different orders of work will be proposed based on your selection.

      # "Topic"

      Choose topics from a range of skills and knowledge development for students to program and quality development for teachers, youth workers, and debate educators.

      # "Age, difficulty"

      Based on the age and experience of the young people you are working with, select the most appropriate content suggestions.
